This is the README file of SuSi program

Description
============
SuSi (StrUcture SImulation) is a Python-based program designed to construct 
high-density amorphous polymer matrices, facilitating molecular dynamics 
simulations of complex polymer systems. Given the challenges of simulating 
polymers due to their amorphous, heterogeneous, and entangled structures, 
SuSi helps generate realistic initial configurations by defining system 
parameters such as box size, and monomer composition. Using an input file 
with system specifications, it creates a 3D polymer system and outputs atomic
coordinates in PDB format. The program ensures accurate molecular 
representation, making it a valuable tool for studying polymer properties at 
molecular and atomic levels.


Prerequisites
=============
SuSi runs directly in the terminal of any Linux-based system and does not 
require installation. However, you must have Python installed (minimum 
version of 3.11.4) and verify it by running the following command in the 
terminal: 

python --version 

SuSi requires the NumPy library. If it is not installed, you can install 
it with: 

pip install numpy 

Once these requirements are met, users can start using SuSi to build 
polymeric Systems structures. 


Files
=====
NOTE: This list is not intended to be comprehensive, but rather to briefly 
describe some of the key files included with SuSi.

* README          This current file

* Susi.py         Python script to run the SuSi program.

* SuSiManual.pdf  Program user manual.

* COPYING         GNU General Public License 3 (GPL).

* /test           A directory that contains input files 
                  with examples to build polymer matrices

* /prepis         A directory that contains monomers in PREPI  
                  format used in the provided examples.

* /susi           A directory that contains Python the modules 
                  necessary to run SuSi.


Running SuSi
============
To execute SuSi, ensure the following files are properly placed in the 
SuSi directory: 

1. The input file containing the system's specifications. 
2. The PREPI files required for the simulation. These files can either
   be located in the same directory as SuSi or organized within their 
   subdirectory (according to what has been defined in the input file). 

Once the files are correctly positioned, run the program using the following 
command: 

python3 susy.py -f <input> 

Replace <input> with the name of your input file. 


Execution Modes and Verbosity Levels 
====================================
SuSi can be executed in two distinct modes and two levels of verbosity. 
These options provide flexibility in how the program runs and how much 
information it outputs during execution. To view detailed information 
about these modes and verbosity levels, use the help command:
 
python3 susy.py -h 

This command will display all available options and their descriptions: 

usage: susi.py [-h] [-t] [-v] -f FILE [-r RESTART]

options:
  -h, --help                   Show this help message and exit
  -t, --testmode               Activate test mode, file.pdb won't be created
  -v, --verbosity              Increase output verbosity
  -f FILE, --file FILE         Input file with system properties
  -r RESTART,--restart RESTART Restart file

When the program is executed in test mode, no pdb file will be generated at 
the end of the process. All the information about the system will be shown 
on the terminal. 


Input file description
======================
All keywords has to be written in lower case
Syntax: KEYWORD,value [UNITS]


KEYWORDS:
======================

• System name: This is a short text with the name of the system and the resulting file.

	Example. Build a system where the resulting file will be PolyethyleneBox.pdb.
	
	system_name,PolyethyleneBox

• Box: The dimensions of the box are specified as Lx n A, Ly n A, Lz n A.

	Example. Build a system in a prismatic box of 35x50x75.5 A3
	
	box,Lx 35 A,Ly 50 A,Lz 75.5 A

• Periodical coordinates: The user can generate the systems inside a periodical simulation box by specifying Y or N.

	Example. Build a system in a non-periodical box.
	
	periodical_coordinates,N
	
• Retries: The maximum number of retries to attempt placing a residue and a molecule inside the box. 

	Example. Set the program to make a maximum of 10 attempts to place each residue and each molecule recursively.
	
	retries, 10

• Minimum distance: All atoms that are closer than this value will be detected as colliders

	Example. Set that any atom located at a distance less than 1.5 Å of another will be a collision.

	minimum_distance, 1.5 A

• Maximum deviation: The maximum percentage deviation to deform a residue due to a collision. 

	Example. Set a random deformation in the structural parameters of the residue within ± 10% of their original values.
	
	maximum_deviation, 10

• Prepis path: Directory where all the prepi files used in the system are located.

	Example. Set the program to look for all the prepi files in the directory prepis/PE. 
	
	path_prepi,prepis/PE

• Number of molecules: The total number of linear chains in the system.

	Example. Create a system with four linear chains.
	
	molecules_number,4

• Molecule lines definition: Each linear chain must be defined on a single line.

	Example. Different ways to define four linear chains of polyethylene containing 12 repeating units. 
	
	PEH, PEB, PEB, PEB, PEB, PEB, PEB, PEB, PEB, PEB, PEB, PET
	PEH, 10 PEB, PET
	PEH, 5 PEB, 5 PEB, PET
	PEH, 3 PEB, PEB, PEB, PEB, PEB, 3 PEB, PET
======================
Systems with crosslinks require the following additional parameters:
======================
• Crosslinks: The total number of crosslink molecules in the system. 

	Example. Create a system with five crosslinks.

	crosslinks,5

• Starting atom bond length: The distance in angstroms between the first atom of the backbone of the crosslink molecule and the starting atom found in a linear chain of the system.

	Example. Set the starting atom bond length to 1.5 Å.

	bond_length_CL_start, 1.5 A

• Closing atom bond length: The distance in angstroms between the last atom of the backbone of the crosslink molecule and the closing atom found in a linear chain of the system.

	Example. Set the closing atom bond length to 1.5 Å.
	
	bond_length_CL_close, 1.5 A

• Distortion angle: The maximum angle in degrees a crosslink residue can be rotated to find a new closing atom. 

	Example. Set the distortion angle to 30º.
	
	distortion_angle, 30

• Crosslink lines definition: Each crosslink molecule must be defined on a single line.The way of defining a crosslink line is: 
	[starting atom name, removable atoms: closing atom name, removable atoms] sequence. 
	The names of the starting and closing atoms are identified using the same nomenclature as the corresponding entries in the prepi file, (column 2)

	The removable atoms to maintain the consistency of the chemical bond can be specified in three different ways: 

        ◦ a) specifying the name of the atom as for starting and closing atoms; 
        ◦ b) setting that all non-M type atoms bonded to the starting or closing atom are removed by writing the keyword branch;
        ◦ c) setting that removing any atom is unnecessary by writing the keyword null. 

	The residue sequence is then defined as for linear chains. 

	Example. Create a crosslink made of 20 PEB  units. The first residue of the crosslink is bonded to any C1 atom of the linear chains.  
	The last residue of the crosslink is bonded to any C2 atom of the linear chains. 
	To keep the chemical consistency, remove H1 atom bonded to C1 atom and H2 atom bonded to C2 atoms.
	
	[C1,H1:C2,H2] 20 PEB
